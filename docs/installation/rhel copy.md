# Event Directors
The role of an Event Director at Code4Hope is integral to the success of our mission to drive social change through technology. As an Event Director, you are responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, and management of our hackathons and other key events. You work closely with team members, sponsors, volunteers, and participants to create impactful experiences that foster innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving. Your leadership helps set the stage for meaningful workshops, competitions, and outreach events.

## Key Areas of Focus
1. **Sponsorships**:
   - We use google sheets to record sponsors names, their company emails, and all thenecessary info to contact them and secure a sponsorship
   - Often, companies keep contact info in their website footer, or on seperate pages ont heir website. Although it's not ideal, finding sponsors does require some manual web-crawling
2. **Workshops**:
   - The best way to grow Code4Hope is to host workshops at other hackathons.
   - You will use a spreadsheet to track hackathon managers’ emails, confirmations, and workshop topics.
